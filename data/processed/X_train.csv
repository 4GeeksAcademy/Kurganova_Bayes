makes life better evernote has saved my bacon multiple times because i could easily find a picture of my drivers license or info on airline clubs or a receipt i needed  i used to keep info like that in contacts and it is much more difficult to search for that way and it clogs up your contacts  plus you can save screenshots websites pictures  anything  and they are searchable
following back it does not let me follow people that have followed me back and also the amount of people following and followers is also incorrect overall it is a live appp
very useful thank god i can finally reply faster with this thanks for the updates
keeps crashing it only works well in extreme data savings mode in high data savings mode it keeps crashing and sometimes websites do not loadplease fix this or i am moving to another browser
it was a great game  until the last update  and cost of upgrade for th10 has always been beyond the reach of the average players  and let us not start about the time to wait for the upgrades to finish   seems like supercell only cares aboutwants high level trophy pushers  and they do not want people who do notcannot buy gems to even to touch this game or maybe even like it
privacy you must provide system in which no one should be able to download profile image moreover if there will be video calling option then 5 rating is must kindly do the needfull
i do not have word to appreciate this  so just thank you verrrry very very very much founder of its
the best i agree totally with the last poster chrome is simply the best for android   period i have tried all the other crap out there and yeah they have some more features none of which i ever used i have chrome on my laptop and pc and all of this is synced together simple direct and to the point and that is what i like and do not forget very fast
good ui ux and helpful in governance looking the fact that indian government specially indian railway and its officials are using twitter app rigorously for assistance and services  i am installing it twitter is changing the way of governance in worlds biggest democracy india team twitter should also look to make twitter better and friendly for governance point of view if any possibility persists for same
lovehate has bug and security issues i tried to report that facebook and google plus have security issues and it would not allow me to do so well i just did did not i 
installed and immediately deleted this crap i have used firefox on my desktop for longer then i can remember and i will continue to only use it on my desktop your only options for a homepage are the crap they want you to see or a blank page with nothing on it and you cannot go to a bookmarked website unless you want to go back to their crappy homepage just to see your bookmark list  and did i mention it is crap
great app love it does what it says of course it is going to be slow if the connection is not fast enough it works well for me and my family who are overseas
will not load everytime i try to use facebook well lately it says trouble loading in every aspect it is been doing this for 2 days i have tried restarting my phone closing the app it does not work
hamro keyboard this is good app no doubt about it however adding some features will definitely make it the best app following are few things observed 1 the option to have the caps lock key enabled should be made available 2 few letters were not available along with words 3 also there are very less options when we go to the numbers option and one of the signs which is missing is the underscore 4 easy toggle option between the phone keyboard and app keyboard should be made post this it will be 5 star
awesome browser really easy to use and more importantly allows you to install ad block extension to get rid off annoying ads love it
nice so far i have been using firefox on my pc for the longest time and love it and it is no different from the android version there are a few things i wish were a bit different but all in all i am happy with it
pics are not loaded i  love using uc browser but the only erorr i  m facing that when i login fb pic are not loaded plz fix dis issue
awesomness this game is awesome but tricky with ice i play all day trying to win i might say i am good at this game but my friends and familyily look over my shoilder and say your playing the game wrong but i love this game
i love this app it is better than tv and old radio
use this with dropsync dropbox autosync dropsync works the way dropbox should have it does not have any noticeable battery drain and automatically uploads files faster than dropbox alone
great app minus the spam best notetaking app honestly this app does everything you could possibly need it to keywords make searching for notes so easy  however please stop pushing me so hard into paying for premium plans i do not need nor do i want them obviously if i am dismissing the ad every time i use the app i must not be interested stop spamming me edit why are you still spamming me please please stop no does not mean keep asking
it takes me two levels back and no boosters not happy with this gamei passed the hard level an i was two level forward to the hard level and i had boostersafter work i open the game no booster and i was two steps back back to the hard levelafter that the game switches its self off
lost power ups switched phones and lost my power ups i had accumulated quite a lot how do i get them back
i love this guy he keep updating this simple app i think this app will rock soon
not bad i like to every news bt i cannot get found new update please update hour by hours
it is notification system is so poor it does not notify me when any message arrives no it is too slow to chat also
too many ads far more adverts than any other game i have played i know it is free and they need the ads to make a profit but there needs to be a balance
bookmark folders what happened to the bookmark folders everything was organized like it was on my computer and now they are just on a list kind of hard to find things when they are like that
new user great app have suggestions so far i love working with the app on all devices desktop web  android phone it integrates very well with other related apps however i would give 5 stars if developers could do 2 things 1 allow check boxesbullet items to be easily reordered dragdrop it is kind of a big deal for me and 2 allow duplication of notes if these functions already exist then hopefully someone will share how to do it or i will figure it out soon enough and then i will gladly rate 5 stars great job guys
ui  customization dark theme and color options reply directly from the notification panel options to change contact photos to initials and hide the timestamps please bring back the gesture that takes you back to the conversation list by swiping from the left edge write a message area is too cluttered make it simplistic with a  sign replace visible phone number with the name of the contact in send sms to
multitab button on topright side is missing  so you cannot switch between multiple tabs easily bcoz the small box on the topright corner that tells you how many tabs r open is not there any more also when you play video in a website the audio and video will not be moving at the same speed meaning the video frams will move ridiculously slow while audio plays at regular speed i guess that is the problem with the flash player overall poor web experience with this browser
excellent reception amazing app that let us you keep in touch with family and friends without the worry of expensive mobile bills
still not background refreshing despite the daily updates this had been working well until a recent version it no longer refreshes in the background and therefore is very slow to load when i open the app stop updating things that used to work
backing up of messages i dnt know why you even added that message back up since morning anytime i open my whatsapp a pop up appears backing up my messageswhich makes me not to be able to read my messages you could have done it in a way that it work in the background but not popping and thus preventing you from reading your messages pls stop that
fantastic love itthis is the best browser on the marketiv tried most of the others and they do not come closekeep up the good work 
two stars cuz after the update it is not working properly it remains connected but when i send a message it is automatically disconnectec and ths message takes aprrox 2 mins or more to sendplz fix this prob as soon as possibletnx

do not download not enough trump memes too much netflix and chill stop already please if you are looking for dumb girls that tweet everything that goes through their heads then this app is for you blessup

very user friendly for those looking for a straight forward note taking app that syncs across devices and has user friendly features look no further evernote simplified my electronic note taking with charm
newest version does not receive push notifications had to revert to original hangouts app until this is fixed
needs an actual update twitter slows down tweets continue to not even send it takes a long time to load a tweet and the timeline i have to use the moblie site version to actually use twitter
its really good but not everyone in your address book is exactly a friend sometimes you do not want certain people to see ua status or dps even if you knw them well so if there could be an additional feature like a favourite list or something like that i would give it a 5 star fo sure
beta is the best version of the chrome browsers cannot open bookmarks in a new tab or incognito window cannot switch tabs from bookmarks tab horrible features the following are issues across all barstools of the chrome browsers no desktop preferred option webpages refresh themselves by default and you lose what you are typing of you switch to another app tabs mixed into os is annoying no user agent switcher
good but ui ease of use still declining i have used evernote for years and it is power is still there in its ability to find notes but its ui is still in steady decline with a lack of ease of use needs cleaner cleaner separation of functionality nowadays i am having to dbl click a found note to view instead of a single click showing the note content disappointing to see this once magnificent software reduced to the current level of ui confusion that  so many other programs exhibit as well
video issues sometimes videos uploaded from places like vine will not load and will play but the screen will show grey fix please i do not know if others have this issue but i am on my samsung s6 and it is doing this
twitter is great to connect with my classmates as i am on exchange at the moment however i cannot view who is liked my posts it will say there is 9 likes but will only show me 3 also the notifications are not very good sometimes it will not tell me if someone has followed me or if they have likedretweeted one of my posts
keeps updating updates all the time slows my phone as it is doing it to a crawl installs for like 3 minutes and the updates never produce anything different or anything of use the only app on my phone that i have issues with
makes everything so easy slack is easy to use and has all the right ridiculously well polished features and it is backed by a genuine caring and honest team it almost seems like they want you to be happy even after you give them your money crazy
it was working great  before the bugs  worse  with the bugd and without
want to get all 5 stars  reduce the amount of time it takes to upgrade buildings instead of days put it hours ietown hall level 6 takes 4 days put it four hoursi never saw a game that goes more than 4 days to upgrade something each month i will remove 1 star if you do not fix it
the new theme is not compatible with my device  samsung galaxy j1 make it compatible please i really love this game

forced reload on uploading pic on replying comment last night i tried to reply a comment by uploading a photo from my phone when i press on the button to select photos the app automatically goes back to the main page on other occasions i could enter to my gallery to select my image but as soon as i selected an image and press done the program again forced reload and suddenly go back to the main page please fix this and i will change my rating thank you
whatsapp tips make it as a medium not base for a friendship do not stop talking if your friend is not online find other ways to interactthis way even if whatsapp not available friend will exist
works great i wish it supported expandable  collapsible hierarchies though
one of the best apps ever at first i was a bit skeptical but i got used to it and now i cannot work without it better even than onenote at least for what i am concerned
good app for free this is a great collabo app especially since it is free  i asked for 2 things and slack delivered 1 proper gif viewing 2 ability to change profile pic from app  functionality complete
its really lovely apps  i am allready using a another mobiles  so knows that about facilities
good app it help us to get fast news
excellent app but still needs a bit more work keyboard is fantastic and english to nepali conversion is pretty accurate  my only comment on improvement is that you need to improve usability and make it more smooth when typing i want to just use this keyboard even when typing english but unfortunately its not just there yet with samsung or google keyboards  also like google keyboard if you add the feature to switch between keyboard by long pressing a button it would be really helpful  then it will get 5 stars good stuff nonetheless
constantly erases text i have frequently lost messages i have been typing sometimes very long ones when the screen changes orientation if i tip my screen even a little and messenger shift the orientation it instantly erases everything i have written
kind of like a 2d kingdom havoc fun  if kingdom havoc was 2d and used a sling shot it would be close  angry birds is crazy good though  a handful of colorful birds with different and interesting superpowers keep things fresh from level to level  this game gets more difficult along the way but it is cool to get better as you practice
it is great when it works but right now it will not download any mms it just says they are there and will not download them and then loses the message when i switch to a different app to try to download it instead
please add this option i love using hangouts for both i am and sms but when sending a photo from the share menu the app defaults to my sms plan thus costing me money if i try to go back the hangouts app quits leaving me with no way to choose of i want to send a picture via mmssms or hangouts i am its costing me a small fortune the option to choose how which messaging service you want to use when sharing a photo would be great
all in one app dis version of uc browser mini disappointed me as search showing in notification bar and when v download anything was not visble in notification bar as previous version its request to look into it and try to solve it otherwise as i have to uninstall it and goto some other app
cannot open after update the app crashes and does not open neither for a second uninstalled and installed many times  no change please let me know how to fix it people write me there and i do not receive nothing
excellent            application       develop    
too bad but improving the earlier version was so nice i have been using that one since the days of nokia symbian the new one is double the size and takes more space it is not even as fast as the earlier one what a shame seems improved after update

hey supercell i would like you to put in a skype in the clan chats when peaple r battleing because you could help them out because you see things they do not and some type of healing defense and thanks for the town hall 11 if you do 5 stars
voice messages problem most times recorded message do not be delivered completely it is always missing a big part of it i noticed that this happens when ever the cellular network is unstable how ever it is a big disadvantage of the app hope you fix it so so i can give the app 5

1 star new update i am a busy man and do not always have hours to play games coc let me pick when i had time to play after the update that is no longer true now i have to get on every few hours and raid for hours and hours just to level 1 building they made the game for the 1 hardcore players not the average player
err how do i back up and restore chat history i used to be able to do that in older versions why would you remove such a crucial feature  even after trying to backup using windows wechat you have no idea where the backup is it says backup on phone but where on phone if it is on the phones internal storage then that is useless to me because i need to wipe it clean to reinstall the system if it is on the sdcard then where comparing to the backuprestore feature of whatsapp wechats is an absolute joke
i think this game is such a load of rubbish it tries to con you into buying stuff from the instore app and because you do not buy anything then you can be stuck on one part of the game for ages worsed app i have ever come across
did not work could not use it with my note 4 it just gets stuck in the red o and stops
it is really nice app i love this app
bug in changing notification sound i gave 1 so developers may look at it now this bug is here since long time as i checked in internet please take a look at it and send a reply or update handset  note 5 hope to see the update and change my rating to 5 again

contact image disappears i do not know y i cannot c the newly added contacts pliz fix dis i will give you 5 stars straight away
use to be a 5 star app i gave this app 1 star and told them i would give more stars after they fixed a particular problem i was having they fixed that problem so i upped it to 4 stars i would give 5 but i am not happy with the changes they made where i now have to use 2 hands to reach for the top of my screen for those functions they use to have on the bottom of the screen this is the only browser i found that does not have to reload every page when hitting the back button definite plus
less space is the magic a complete package with very less space but still i would love to see a bit modern design
its getting there i used to be a chromeopera aficionado but lately they eat too much ram that my phone starts to hang firefox memory consumption is far less and it is more stable however i dislike how websites get blurred when scrolling then slowly clear up like a jpeg being downloaded on a slow connection i use 4g and bandwidth are not a problem i know you can fix it but i will give you 4 stars for now thanks for the awesome browser
do not like the new look looks like a cheap dating site now professional vibe is gone poor facebook knockoff is here to stay it is not just the aesthetics but the design as well simple things like viewing my connections or viewers require more time more taps and more effort than before others connections are listed seemingly randomly making it arduous to find anyone it is worse on iphone where speed is at a snails pace linkedin has lost its identity and if it continues in this direction it will lose its userbase too

game glitches nice you have all the cheesy simple reviews right up first hey robin i was nearly completed the game and i had to uninstallreinstall losing all my achievements and it is still freezing up it even switches to one if those annoying 30 ads in the middle of a game is there a reason why my game was working just fine until the update
ads are way to heavy listen to the bad reviews there are ads after every round whether you pass it or fail it sometimes there are ads before the next round starts to you spend more time on ads than game play i develop web apps and honestly many people rely on ads to make a living i can appreciate that all to well however these developers have went far beyond that frankly they are disrespectful nitwits
very useful but very useful and good performance improvements but i can not find a way to set myself online or away anymore after the update where did it go
was great broken with marshmallow i lauded evernote for working across more devices and os than other products but dropping stars as with android 6 if you format sdcard as internal required to effectively use sdcard for apps and games evernote will not run it asks for a memory card
connection issues with the version it says cannot connect to server  with error report 1 1 everytime either connected with cellular data connection or over wifi

please do not stop carousel  google has improved their gallery app google photo to make google drive better for photo backup cannot only store photos but also create interesting effects animations and story for users and even unlimited space however meanwhile you decided to give up carousel i am a royal user of dropbox but do not you know that photo backup is one of the most important things while one chooses an online storage tool wish this will not be the turning point that dropbox is beaten by google drive
external links are not working after updated to latest version could not able to open any links on facebook  it is says connect to network after some time  plz check your network connection  same time my connection is 4g network is at full speed  plz fix this issue as soon as possible thanks
it sucks i am always shown offline and unable to send a single message  to my team
annoying sometimes why does opera need to reload the pages i have opened for later viewing i have a decent phone with a lot of ram the old opera could do this just fine so why cannot the new one  my other problem occurs when reading text that requires zooming in and panning when scrolling down the address bar disappears great that is fine but when i pan left right it appears again  jolting my text up and down making me loose my place highly annoying still happens when i toggle full screen 
widget sabotaged this app functions ok as a notetaker i access it primarily through its widget the old widget was great giving a peek at a few recent notes then that widget was killed off and replaced with a widget that shows only the titles of 2 recent notes with maybe just part of the title of a third note and no content at all it shows poor judgment for a company to downgrade its product for no apparent reason also there is no undo button
i cannot send messages because in my settings i do not have sms all i have is account settings fix it i thought when i got it it would be good but i thought wrong
its suck any time when i want to see something error will come could not open check your internet satting else i am using all other applications and other things on net hance i am using 4g network realy very suck
add   search people if you do not have the persons number  but they have whatsapp you should be able to search their name and then  add them or something  then it would be 5 stars 
great app i really liked this app and its very useful as well little upgrade should be made for theme and if possiblethen for swift as well best of luck guys and keep it up
google chrome app it allows me to browse the internet on a phone of all things seriously guys we are living in the future 5 stars because it always works

miui7 y is the photo n sights will not show up in moment although i refresh so many time ad fix the probs pls
too many recent glitches i used to play this all the time i am level 500 but now cannot even log into the game it started removing received boosters n not recording passed levels so they would have to b replayed now it tries to load for 58 mins then just kicks me off have not been able to play for weeks now will b uninstalling soon if not fixed really disappointed with candy crush now
does not seem to work at all no widget and does not sync with site
bad bad google why was i sent to password recovery options when updating a browser app  5 stars  is it time to go to an apple or windows phone platform america
would like to see who are currently online performance of the latest app has deterioted where is the list of online friends one of the most important aspects of gtalk which never let me shift to other chats is the fact that i can know who all are online and i can chat with by chat i mean i can get replies and have a conversation please incorporate this feature at the earliest so that i can install this back
sort option not working they have just provided options for sort new to older but it never works
slow update slow firefox just keeps on getting better with each update  so far it is the only one that supports flash wo force close that i have used on 44 kitkat  keep up the great work guys
not good its previous version 12001514 is much good than that i cannot text directly with current version please add the inbuilt messenger again in the app
what the heck cannot get status updates to be in chronological orderhalf of my comments do not postit worked fine before the last updatekeeps kicking me out of the app for no reason  will not let me tag people without their name being all jumbled if i edit a post it shows the unedited version at the top of my feed i am 2 seconds away from uninstalling
having a headache because of this enough with the limits on this app okay i was trying to get rid of some tweets on my account and it is telling me cannot retweet status or when i try and tweet something failed to send tweet like seriously
what is the point of having the jackpot when we spin the wheel if i never get it i mean has anyone ever got the jackpot if not i think it is completely pointless and should be taken off
does what it says it does but chat heads have limitations the issue i have almost everyday is that when a conversation is open in a chat head you can not paste what is copied to your clipboard everything is works fine enough
cannot download pics i used to be able to download pics from a conversation and save them to my phone i do not have that option anymore long press gives me about every other option but not the option to download
every time i press the send button a black background appears this does not happen before the update it sucks coz it forces whatever i am doing to stop like watching videos
very good but reposition and either fix or remove the share link button the bookmarks not syncing issue was fixed a while back i have been happy with this app for a while now i just forgot to change my previous review that is not to say that it is without its problems however having gotten used to chrome i find myself pressing share link rather than open link in new tab while this normally is not a problem lately pressing share link causes the app to crash please either fix this issue and reposition share link lower or remove it altogether
error i cannot edit my post with pictures the moment i do it will not change after save and it appears like when you are uploading but not yet done post in news feed and still there until i did reinstall the app this still happens even
easy to use safe super easy to use fantastic online backupstorage app twostep verification makes this relatively safe
so disappointed my candy crush would not connect to fb so i uninstalled and reinstalled still did not work so i restarted my phone that worked only i am two levels back and all my power ups are gone
man i hate google and android went into my messaging and the default had changed to hangouts instead of sms stop forcing settings to change when you push through updates man i am moving to apple as soon as i am able i hate this phone and your system
its ok useful appxcept now viber has not been working greatsometimes its says disconnected or something although i have a stable internet connectioni hope this gets fixed
great game too much ads angry birds is fun and a great way to kill time unfortunately it falls short of perfect due to numerous ads littering the game unless you get adfree be prepared to get ads up the butt
really i honestly ussd to love this app now i realize it is honestly terrible i still use it every so often but for sms i suppose there is bulk in the programming but i can have 4g lte and be told i have no signal to send a text you are better than this google
connection issues everytime i try and click on a link or profile i keep getting can not refresh it does this whether its on wifi  lte 4g so i am finding myself having to continuously close app from multitasking and re load it periodically
buggy when i edit a post through the mobile app that post freezes and even restarting the phone does not resolve  unfreeze this does not happen via the desktop app on my pc not did it happen with previous android app version
it is been 1 or 2 months and you all still have not fix the this recent december 2015 update has made the gameplay so lopsided that i can not compete with anyone l attack  there is now no reason for me to invest anymore time in coc  can no longer protect my loot and no shield
book and their use as a great christmas navarro was going to get a lot of different names for christmas is a screamer and i cannot remember if my sis and baking and making everything so perfect for me to believe in things and i will return to go over in a few minutes ago and i have a great day at home soon and their little room in the kids to school with your questions
sumpreme game but wizards take 8 min and hogs must be strongened i mean there are giants bombs and  skeletons so why do not you incraese hogs abilities and pl make it we can use elixer and gold from walls lvl 8
like button the like button you know the thing that you can actually change now with a stickerie snowman after the update it has never worked on me i have tried uninstalling and reinstalling and nothing it still do not work
no stickers why is there no stickersit is not fun you should make arrangement of stickersnori will uninstall this app
downloading files in background i started a song download but it failed  then after 2 minutes it automatically downloaded 2 copies of the song in background
better user interface worse quality the user interface is definitely better now but at the same time there is a bug concerning synchronising the contacts with the phone contacts and even when that bug got fixed the contact photo does not get shown any more in contrary to previous releases
boo it loads slow even on my hardware considering kmg is the leading news company  the interface is very poor i your app is almost like direct links to your websites and the difference between the low resolution and high resolution files in epaper is not perceivable at all
kill pages i will enter a url or open a new link and nothing loads no loading bar no error page  the page stays the same also if i switch to a new tab sometimes that will not loadrefresh or if i switch back to an old tab the same thing happens
fantastic and helpful i find this app so helpful i have the paid version would not really want the free version as i love being able to take photos of business cards and turn them into contacts it also has the ability to find text within pdfs which is also extremely useful
awesome game but this is such a great game but there are way to many adds every time you get passed a level there is another add but even with all the adds it is still an amazing game
fun diversion good game to take a quick break from whatever you are doing nice test of your ability to see and hear what is coming ahead and react the latest update with the winter map improves the core game quite a bit
stay on your toes with a new issue every month every time i solve an issue with this app a new one seems to crop up recently i stopped receiving sms from my husband who uses google voice went through the troubleshooter which directed me to make sure his messages are not ending up in the spam folder well that is only accessible from the desktop app you cannot even view spam messages from the android app or the mobile website gtfohwtbs
love this app all in one nepalese app 
cannot install error code 505 have samsung galaxy note edge had issues and could not update so i uninstalled the app and now i cannot reinstall it total bs
great app the latest update to slack has enabled an in app experience for gifs and while it is not the smoothest implementation it is definitely a step in the right direction really enjoy using the app and their responsiveness to user comments makes this a great experience
slick chat app reactions are my favorite part of using slack i love adding my own
awesome cannot be productive without evernote  i always find myself searching for new and old notes  great app
really cool and organized the new update is really amazing the widgets are cool however it would be helpful if you could add right to left reading and writing support like hebrew because when i want to add check box the text removed to the left also you need to add an option to change the size of the preview do not like it is so small and app animations would be nice something else to your attention i want to by the app but it really really expensive if it was cheaper and one time charge i would buy it

nice browser but there is no doubt that firefox is one of the best browsers out there be it pc or mobile great options to customize the browser to suit your needs however this still continues to be my secondary browser as cm browser is still way to fast even when loading heavy websites i hope the speed improves in newer versions and i will add a 5 star rating
the ads ruin my fav app i mean the ads for viber desktop i dial my friend start talking and what happens next is my microphone turns off speakers turn on and the browser starts launching so my friend is saying something for everyone to hear because she cannot hear me and i am pushing buttons like crazy trying to stop browser from launching it does take a while on my phone what happens every time is that viber desktop ad launches about 3s after i make a call that is the right way to stop me using the smartphone app

classic game ruined by ads uninstalled this o one classic game utterly unplayable due to excessive ads installed the other day for my 5 year old to keep him quiet wondered why he kept crying and complaining realised he was constantly being bombarded with adds that took him out of the game after almost every level ridiculous

translation use it for browsing and visiting viet and chinese and other country sites for translations but using uc browser for downloading no other app can replace uc for fast downloading speed

2many adds great game ruined by too many adds way too many adds now not even fun anymore was great now it is terrible
  yo hamro keyboard chai computerma pani banauda ramro hunthyo tara i love it n thanks for this i support you all
the app made me i am rating it because of a pop up on the appbut i like twitter so i am going to give it 5 stars the only thing i do not like is the fact that i cannot edit postsfing instagram can but twitter does not have option wtf
very solid my one real complaint is no way to make anchor tags within a note so i can make a table of contents otherwise great application
i love it i love using uc browser mini because browsing speed of it is marvelous and mind blowing and the size of this app is so small so overall i would like to say that size of it is small but the work of it is big and awesome

superfast just as i remember it  opera mini was the 1 browser back in the days of symbian glad to see itstill up there superfast smooth minimal data used as opposed to chrome which is starting to stutter  lag even on simple pages with a few commercials
ugly design no autoimport from old install iphone ui design in the android app come on one day it suddenly would not start  just showed globe and quit nothing similar has happened with alternative apps on top of that when i reinstalled it ignored the user folder so even though pics and supposedly chat is in there wechat did not read the folder so it is all empty in chats inside wechat after a reinstall awful
bye to coc my th9 and no loot option after th9 i found the only 1lac loot or less when someone attack on my clqn they got more then 2lac not possible to upgrade any thing
unsatisfactory version older version was more user friendly than this one i cannot see my rank among my connection and colleagues this is really bad i wish to revert back to old version
too many updates of too big size please only send updates that are really really necessary last one 4022mb  if every app  which it seems it is  keeps doing updates we all end up with no room on our devices having 15mb of languages i am never going to use is a waist of memory 
seriously needs usability updates app is ok but storage jumps from free to 10mo after downloading files dropbox asks to upload it great but it asks for the folder every time from the root directory still there is no intermediate plan for storage it goes from free to 10 mo for 1 tb i do not need 1 tb but i do need something more than the free plan google drive will be my new storage since they offer an intermediate plan i asked for something middle of the road but they are not interested i am going to drop dropbox where it belongs in the trash box
app requires frequent login password why the hell this app everytime requires password to openthis is not expected from proffesional app like thiswho the hell remembers password for each and every app or site
loading login i redownload because my wechat is full  when bufring loading  always stuck at 2 and 3 then force close pls fix it  i will give 5star if you fix it
very useful 
just a tool for them to throw ads at you they use this app to electronically monitor your messages looking for key words once it recognizes a grouping of words it will start to send adds to your news feed that are similar in subject to that of which your talking about in your conversations
i remember back when this was a 3 ipod app not filled with bullshit like adds and powerups go back to what you used to be rio ruined every other angry birds game
gave you too many chances i love desktop firefox this app is brutally annoying an cumbersome i have installed it about 5 times thinkinghoping it would get better there are much better browsers for android than this eg dolphin or maxthon
causes a lot of battery drainage so i love firefox both on pc and android but i have noticed recently that firefox has been draining a lot of my battery before this was never an issue firefox always ran smoothly but now certain webpages with glitch out jump back up to the top of the page on random or just not load completely i have checked my wifi and data so that is not the issue it seems like the app is working harder than it needs to and it always makes my phone very hot
pretty good if i do say so myself oh wait i did it is a very fun game to play
came here to rate this app to give 5 stars for good optimization for android this is one of the only apps that i open and close and it actually clears fully from ram and does not use up cpu power unlike facebook and its messenger using up ram and cpu
the scoring system on facebook gains more points than mobile on jelly levels and i think that needs to be changed eg  using a colour bomb with jellies on candies gives much more points on fb  than mobile also there are no fish once  you finish jelly levels please change the scoring system so it is the same for both platforms and that there is no bias against mobile
good job but please reduce its size running services should consume less memory in background  in new version there is no option to show only viber accounts in contacts menu it shows all contacts only  blocked contacts should be invisible after blockingshow only allowed contacts thanks
camera roll please can you stop the camera roll popping up at top of page whenever it does i cannot use the app or my phone for a few mins  doing my nut in
ok for the simple stuff feature lacking and poor layout for your basic messaging it is fine but it still lacks sending voice messages and video clips can be a bit slow to load conversations overall the recent changes in ui make it feel cloogy simple actions like opening the app or going back to the message listview shows a signing in spinner  which is obviously not ideal for every other action especially since it uses google auth services 
simply brilliant simply brilliant no problems so far  the best feature of this is the accordion of tasks that are grouped  could not login with google but simply clicked forgot password and set a new password and it worked perfectly as described in both the description and app  cheers
good need to use every nepali peoples
did not work i looked for a movie and the app said it was no such thing as i looked up big mommas house 2
update uninstalls everytime i try to update it uninstalls the app what i want to know is if this is using my data each time i update and then have to reinstall driving me crazy please fix

lack of options and closed code so many options for years not implemented and now whatsapp is simply copy pasting the features telegram creates moved to telegram which is whatsapp but on steroids which even offers desktop integration so you can use it on the pc and more

great application but the premium notifications have become too invasive leading to unpleasant clutter alternative options are becoming much more attractive due to this
inferior to desktop browser i love firefox on my desktop but the android version is terrible 1 it crashes constantly 2 scrolling is very jerky 3 on screen rotation the window does not resize 4 there is no word wrap when answering certain forums 5 downloaded images are not available for use in forums or whatsapp without rebooting phone 6 pages are very slow to load both the preinstalled samsung browser and chrome are heads and shoulders above firefox pity

looks great works well and supports ubuntu but needs removable storage support an application like this is only as good as the service behind it and this is where dropbox excels  it works flawlessly securely and even has a native client available for linuxbased operating systems ubuntu and steamos my only real complaint is the lack of support for removable storage such as micro sdxc memory cards for which a star is lost

i do not want to search for new connections every time i open the app no means no just live with it and keep the experience smooth
ads placement is anoying we know ads was one of your source of income but placing ads in replies is taking anoying and greed to another level facebook had more ads but have you ever see them in the comments section

linda cooper hardy it is essential at times to communicate one person to another  not open to all to read or know  i like that aspect of the messenger field sometimes on facebook i wish i could have a one to another conversation about  whatever  i find it necessary to discuss more personal subjects that may start on facebook then end up on messenger  like a phone with no party lines i would enjoy a privacy option  for now we have messenger
wonderful for project coordination this is a great tool to have when coordinating projects it keeps everyone on the same page and in communication
video issues since i was forced into this update the videos play with a black box in the middle of them i edited a photo and its grayed out and stays at the top of my news feeds and my timeline it will not even let me delete it if i could give a zero star i would just like ever update something is always not working if its not broke why fix it

some notification problem although i have enabled notification  i am not being able to get notification only from ekantipur on my htc desire 826 and it is slower than in other inferior devices i want to know if this problem is only with me or ekantipur is working on this kind of devicenotification feature is very useful for a busy person like me who does not get much time to sit back and read news notifications enables to take a quick look at headlines and understand the situation and can read the selected news according to choice
neat idea but letdown by no linux support an application like evernote is only as useful as the service behind it and the service behind a concept like evernote is only as useful as the availability of an application or program to connect to said service which is where evernote fails  it is not natively available for linuxbased operating systems such as ubuntu sure the android application works well enough  but when the only way to access evernote under a linuxbased operating system is via a web browser it quickly looses its appeal
occasionally i will not receive a notification of a messages so i do not know that someone has replied until i actually open the app and then suddenly lots of messages come through 5 stars if that can be fixed
has potential could be better but it conts to crash after some use love the web version though
no google sync uninstall until it can sync with google calendar i hate having to use separate apps for these things

do not use if you have a lot of organized bookmarks they recently changed bookmarks to go to the top of of your bookmarks every time you open a new tab it used to remember what bookmark folder you were in until a recent update i also do not like that the folders are now at the top of each bookmark list  i will be using firefox now
great app i mainly use it to keep the team together cross sites
please include membership when viewing lists i am on samsung android and i do not know if this applies with android users in general but this app version does not seem to include the option of seeing what member a user belongs to in viewing lists it is available on web browser though please consider including members of list option in the app

mark i found viber to be extremely efficient way to communicate with my loved one i have skype as well but it is not as good as viber
unexpected the new update does not let you change your profile pic and the profile pic cannot be seen properly after selecting fix it
messenger issues ever since the last update initial received messages do not get pushed to the messenger app and you do not get notification in the facebook app or messenger app you open the facebook app and happen to see you have a message you have to click the icon and it opens messenger subsequent messages go through messenger app unless you close the chat head then you start over with no notification and having to go through the facebook app
its cool my brother does not bug m me anymore i show him angry birds and his mouth shuts but some levels are almost impossible and i have to wait for free power ups or buy them
why there is a delay on the messages you will know you have messages when you open the app it does not notify you even if you are connected to internet wtf
very reliable syncing butthe web ui looks like it is been designed by a college kid with a laptopno grid view2gb free space in 2016wah photos look ridiculous on  list viewthe android app does nothing but getting bigger and bigger with each update without adding up any noticeable featuretoo plain and oversimplified uino download option directly to sd card

account creation issue i tried to create an account but it keeps saying cannot create an account at this time
old version was better this new version needs lots of work find web pages take much longer to load cannot tell it not to remember passwords for all sites
ever so useful evernote it is so easy to scribble something down when you have your smart phone tablet laptop or whatever  you can be spontaneous yet accurate because you write when you are at the place and at the time  when you return to your main computer your writing is there waiting for you  almost magical  such a time saver and a memory keeper
makes top left of my screen unresponsive many lg v10 users lose the ability to tap the top left of their screen when this app is installed this issue makes uses other apps impractical and sometimes impossible as this issue holds phones hostage if fixed i will change my review to 5 stars
awsome but i  this game but i do not like the frozen bit my sister has had eye site and she can see the normal one and she cannot  see the frozen ones so she keeps dieing luckerly we can change back to the normal one but the frozen one takes longer to load so when the frozen whone is out the window i will rate 5 stars but the rest is awesome
notification so much update in a every week but notification still suck it stuck when app destroyed by system and will not appear when app started why
why cannot google get it for a company being the most used internet search engine you would think google would be smart enough to conjure a team up to fix these problems they have i also agree with a few others who thinks google messages and hangouts should combine somehow to make it work how the iphones imessage works
viber rating  lacking code on the android phone the in call widget is over the top command for all settings alterations on the screen it is not able to be moved and i cannot find the setting to turn it off might want to fix it also it seems not to want to ring on the android phone when you make a call
angry birds what looks easy can demand a bit of skill the player may become frustrated but is never bored i always find angry birds a great way to pass the time most adverts allow a skip click
wechat 63 with wechat out is no longer free hate it for wechat out now as it is no longer free which playback sound of video is muted after finishing call with wechat out why charge when it is not up to mark yet

night mode this app is really good actually but why the night mode does not work what ashame 
nice for the size it is great  nice ui  small footprint complain  you belong in scroogles camp 
really great twitter is an amazing app which i use frequently each day i do have problems with it though this is personal preference whenever i refresh the page it gives me a tweet with the subtext twitter name follows twitter name and it happens every time i refresh so can you only do it once since it clogs my feed with it whenever i want to see new tweets othe than that its fine

great game really dislike the ads i usually do not  write reviews but this time i am because it is getting  ridiculous every few rounds you play an ad will pop up out of nowhere while you are playing and interrupt your playing sessions making it extremely annoying i know the ads help with money but at least reduce the amount of time until the next ad pops up and forces you to watch it
1 great game challenging to the point where you do not want to give it up great thing while you are bored waiting or just want to play cannot stop playing great job rovio

this used to be my favorite app this was the only app that i used for messaging for quite a while that was all the way up until the notifications stopped working this has been a major annoyance and has proved to be extremely problematic as well i love everything about this app apart from the fact that it does not notify me when i get a message since this is a google application you would think that a bug so simple would be gotten rid of but i must say i am quite disappointed with the google team
good but not great app is awesome saves me a ton of memory but i think it should add a few more features to make use even better 1 you should had a select all button when moving upload pics to dropbox albums its a real pain checking individually 250 pictures to move to album 2 once pictures are in album the thumnail should sell you how many pictures are currently in that album if you could do those 2 things it would be 
contacts sync will not work contacts do not sync anymore app crashes i have tried uninstalling clearing data and cache updating but the issue persist should not had released this version with so many bugs

possible solution to trounle entering site i like this ap   one reviewer says he could not get in after installing it  at installation i was asked if i wanted to go through google or facebook i think  i choose google  now when i call it up there is a link to sign up here  if i pressclick on that link it opens my todo page  try that
does not work every time i try to sign up it says could not processes registration it did the same thing on my android tablet and my doogee x5 cell phone please fix and i will rate 5 stars
garbage no user choice allow users to lock the toolbar it makes no sense to hide the url just for a tiny bit of extra vertical space on big screens also needs option to show tabs on top rather than in a separate screen for the same reason still no pdf support finally stop unloading tabs when there are gigabytes of free ram overflow menu is a cluttered mess
all nepali must use

call disconects in every 5 seconds that is two beep sound is now one of my most hated sound from viber cannot you guys fix it before i uninstall the app and use other app
very useful i have not used it as much as i could but even for what i do evernote is one of my favorite apps of all time they just keep making it better and better their widgets make the all even cooler
what is new broken differently again too bad google is such a small company it does not have the resources to create a good product the latest update has now made the camera go almost black and the speaker has stopped functioning i have to hold the phone up to my ear to hear the other person
almost good enough i have tried lots of android browsers the reason being that i like speed and simplicity and good bookmark management that is all i need i tried firefox which i use on desktop as a way of getting away from chrome because i absolutely hate google and everything and everybody associated with it seriously i hate google unfortunately chrome is still hands down the best browser i have used on android firefox started out fine but became slower and glitchier as i used it like everything except chrome meh
buggy after update after the update chrome will freeze chrome is not responding which gives me an option to wait for it or kill the app this happens every time i reopen the app and some times from recent
nyc  1 you guys should apply some same strategy as you applied in boom beach when we use the troops the remaining undead troops should return to their base but instead of that they r deadfix this for remaining 2 star frm me

slow with weird lack of features really slow not sure why has good search bar but no way to add search engines cannot download images from google search no problem  downloading from bing it seems there are good feature spread between this and opera mobile combined they would make a good browser but independently they are not good enough
awesome
 you can not send vids on some android devices you can on some apple devices but they have to be under 16 seconds and you have to make them you cannot use short vids from your albumcamera roll but video calling is good you also cannot have a icon for a group chat  everything else is good except sometimes it takes 10 minutes to send one text
decent but getting worse with each update was my undisputed goto app for browsing for the past couple of years until about now getting buggier with each update crashes frequently especially when a lot of tabs are open simultaneously unresponsive for a few heavy websites still hoping the devs at google fix this because i am still a huge chrome fan and going to continue using it
profile issues samsung galaxy s4 active so every time i post a pic on fb it says not available and i cannot even edit it it shows some gray part on top plzz fix it i would of rated a 5 but since this happened i rated 2

what happened to you opera the resent updation make the browser more beautiful to look  than the previous versions but the smoothness of the browser is gone yes it have some unique properties whwn compared to other browser such as data saving modere open closed tab etc but the problem which i face is that  1 the web pages are not fit to my screen ie the all the web pages opend through this browser is shows only34 part of my screen   2 annoying ads on the home screen of the browser   3 private browsing is not working
why we have to use this google we think its a time to make some changes in your team who is planning and making this horrible aps is apple or microsoft paying you for that what is about dark theme for the beginning for this useless app and make ability for sending files pls make everything in one place we do not need dozen usless aps
it was epicthen a certain update happened the most recent update got rid of what a ton of people loved i think supercell has some work to do if they think i am going to be buying any more gems
bugs with contact syncing very frustrated after having this app work fine for a couple years i get an update that screwed up my contacts i have read others comments and the supposed solutions including uninstalling and reinstalling the app for a brief few hours last night it appeared to resync my linkedin contacts back to my phone contacts today gone again in any case even when the contacts came back all my previously set up shortcuts to those contacts were disabled can you fix this linkedin i use a samsung galaxy 3s
not responding occasionally sometimes chrome just will not respond it does not seem to be fixated on a certain website or so it happens at random it is far much better than before and yes it is not my phones fault as i can just press the home button and operate my phone no problem there
developers please read i think there needs to be some kind of confirmation implemented when the buy extra moves for 9 gold bars button is clicked i recently did not do so well on a level and i ran out of moves when going to press end game  i  pressed the extra moves by accident and it took 9 bars even though i had no intention of continuing i felt hurt after saving them up for so long please consider this
yup first thing i thought of for comment was freedom of choicevery important some of the people making choices for us are not well the i thought tony bennetthe good lifeto be sussinct
not as good before and rapidly getting worse if used solely for viewing sites without personalization or adjusting the settings this browser has no problems i know of no benefits either issues begin to arise and multiply exponentially upon applying any changes if using a text size other than the default a substantial lagreloading begins to occur when scrolling zooming in or out causes large  portions of previously loaded content to go blank also in one week this went from the download size of 45mb to over 113mb without my adding any extras
the new updates are cool but  whenever i try to favourite a tweet now it closes the app saying unfortunately twitter has stopped maybe it is just my android i do not know
way below expection why does it lag so much scroll garda ni freeze hunxa get it right kntipur i expected so much
no upgrades to the game till yetthe developers have no idea how to do upgrades most of the people have stopped playing it because it got old and there is no fun playing it now
keeps crashing ever since i started using it more it will crash every ten minutes its starting to get more annoying however it is convenient for saving text messages since i do not have unlimited messaging
great best cross platform cloud storage and has some awesome functionality it is without a doubt the best cloud storage out there
very poor service now a days for the last one month viber service is detoriated day by daynow the application respond too slow even in 3g network in wifi the message is always displayed that no network available please check your internet connection what happend to developer team are they sleeping from google market viber has disappeared suddenly
no respect for privacy linkedin takes advantage of how android manages permissions as well as using an persistent opt out mechanism to aggresively scan your phones contacts in order to constantly nag about inviting them whilst the app harvests your data the practices are unethical and makes one question how the company treats private data linkedin is an important tool to use today but with the way the company behaves it is better to uninstall the app and rely on the web version when its needed
does what it says i love this site for my computer and wish it had a more mobilefriendly interface this app does what it says it does i just find it so unorganized and a little bit stressful to use good start room for improvement
regular uc better on powerful devices this is very similar to the regular uc browser in function in some ways the layout is cleaner especially in the settings menu the major advantage here is in memory usage typically this will use about 40mb starting up  the regular uc browser uses almost four times the memory however on my samsung galaxy edge the scroll speed is very laggy and stilted i love uc but i am sticking with the full version where no such lag occurs it is probably not fair to compare them on a high end phone however
auto capitalization needed it does not automatically capitalize the first letter of sentense in english keyboard its an essential feature please fix it
very bad i use xperia x8 and i think this app sucks it never logs in no matter how many times i change the password it always says it is not the right one it also is not categorizes as a safe app since its certificate is different then its name so the antivirus has to be off for it to connect futhermore it has no way to be synced to the google account that allows you acces on the internet version
 when will this app be created to automatically start at the top with new posts instead of having to scroll through days of old tweets to get to the top the only social app that does that such a headache
another update and still crashing previously trieddisabled add on tried re installing another new update crashing every few minutes and still cannot sync data
know how to get the account back you have to delete clash of clansthen you download it again then you look on the upper left corner of the screen then you see already have a village then you press itthen you will have your village
chatheads disappears chatheads keep on disappearing even if i am not closing it what is the sense of the messenger without that quick access and the app still force closes itself even at times that imw not using it

i have to call it one of the most addictive games ever but now i am dropping my rating because it took all my bonus candy away with the last update fix that guys not ok
classic browsing at it is best i have recently upgraded to android from a bb9900 i have been using opera on my bb for years was actually disappointed with android at first until i installed mini webpages like facebook are back to the way they should be please do not change a thing using mini for facebook is the best where can i donate
could be so much better if they would stop making unneeded changes while i love twitter i hate that there is no paid service to remove ads also there should be a quicker way to access your lists like a shortcut on the home screen to a specific list would be awesome and also i have heard that twitter is testing a nonchronological timeline that is the worst idea ever if that is implemented without a way to turn it off i will not use twitter anymore honestly if third party apps had push notifications i would not use the official app at all oh and moments is dumb
great fun very addictive still brilliant loads of fun very clever and hugely moreish and i still love it
still no notifications ugghh please fix cannot talk to people if you do not k ow you have a message and have to click hangout for it to load or send a message to see what you received   used to be a great app for my galaxy note 2 now its just blah its sad i used hangouts for phone and my chrome booknow it do not work for my phone and  only works for the chrome once in a while  please please ease fix notification and become a 5 star app again
absolutely the best for saving documents forms notes or whatever it is that you may end up needing on the go  you can have one or twenty different books to store and organize your information in  edit word and excel documents without having to save them to your computer and save them again into your books  tag one document in ten different locations so if you can use it in multiple different situations you do not have to worry about where you saved it  just look it up under the tag that you need to use it for  it is that easy
good app all is good but sometime its cannot see live but otherwise its great app
free the gifs not reliable on a slower network  messages frequently do not send
firefox for android ok not full firefox but a good interpretation for small touchscreen devices firefox sync works well bookmarks and search history transfer as expected really helps following up with web searching on the road when i get home to the computer
this new update crashed with my samsung note4 my phone suddenly all black out   shut down after receiving a wechat message notification after update my chat backgrounds were all gone blank  i cannot find my stickers as well i have to uninstall the app  but do not know if my chat history will be here or not
uninstalled i downloaded this app thinking it would soon be supported with google for log in and sync with chrome web version cannot or will not do two separate  apps for a to do list    will give 5 star when this is a reality
still broadcast list did not improved you should improve back up option you should give 2 options 1 with media 2 without mediaonly chats
not a fan of new update new update makes it difficult to progress unless you attack several times during your shield period  i cannot get ahead i play twice a day if i can  cannot commit to getting on 46 times a day
candy crush i rated it a 2 star because when i send out ticket request i never get them i know for a fact that 6 people sent me tickets back and i only got 1
trust worthy as always have been a long time user of firefox in all my desktops and laptops now using it on my android phones as well not settling for any other second rate browser
bookmarks the option to open a bookmark in a new tab is taken away i use that feature and would like it back also now the keyboard opens automatically which i often do not want and have to close it
great perfect no complaints
once a great game i was a hardcore fan of this game but you got to admit the latest update sucks its impossible for farming if you want to make some loot you going to have to go gowipe or something it takes a minimum of 1 hourwithout boost to make troops and that sucks plz fix this as soon as possible before i with many others move on
best hamro nepali keyboard is doubtlessly the best keyboard for fluent nepali typing on android mobiles and tablets it has given  oppurtunity to thousands of nepalese people for sharing their thoughts expressing their feelings and chatting up with buddies through  common and national language ie nepali thumbs up for creating this amazing app wish you would also add some theme customization options and improved caps lock option

temple run 2 frozen shadows i love this game so much i love being in the ice but only one thing that i hate about it is that the monster goes infront of you when your running but as you go further into the game it gets harder but able to pass the monster

viber sarl this app helps me to stay in contact while also having video options and picture options really nice app and pretty stable running just a few video and audio issues as well as video and call drops which can be annoying sometimes the app is unstable but is mostly attributed to network issues rather than the app itself i recommend this app
better background playback and new tab position firefox is the bestlooking browser on android if i do say so myself what i hope for are video sounds playing smoothly when the app runs in the background since i use youtube as ambience a lot and the new tab button being on top of the menu like the other browsers to make navigation easier

bad new update sight by swipe in chats gone please put back the option where users could quickly record a sight just swiping down on the chats screen it is horrible to try to record a sight now having to go through so many screens by the time it is open now the moment is gone i have missed many moments i would have recorded before why change something that works well and not broken
few ui updates 1 group should be included with group status so that if common event is there then the event can be posted through group status and group name need not be changed   as it becomes difficult to identify a particular group if a particular festival is there and all group name seems to be similar         2 profile picture and profile status should be at one place not seperate for status we have shortcut but for profile picture we have to go into settings then profile then comes profile picture
fastest browser it is fast it is reliable the only problem i have with it it do not like to download videos or games so both videos  games it goes to the site just no downloads come up  also the lil emojis that have action to them it do not show their lil action i would give a 5 star rating but until then a 3 star is all i hate that to cause this really is a fast browser maybe the fastest so please fix those bugs
personal break do not mind the break necessarily  but i do not think its necessary  especially during gem boost time  would like to not be told when i cannot play lol
excellent a excellent option if you are looking for a good browser which has speed and is less complicated too and solves most of the search options with built in quick links good one mait 
not enough space 6g is nothing these days need at least 32g to store all the memory hungry apps as every update gets bigger and bigger as the quality and functionality get smaller and smaller please do not go to that material crap   not evertone likes the cheap material design it is designed for lazy devs who like the easylazy way

simple fun game this is the type of game that can be easy and difficult at the same time each game is determined by how the candies drop so sometimes you can fly through a level and other times you can be stuck for days a good time filler when you have 5 mins to spare

too slow loading webclips no pdf support at all even simpler apps do that  web pages that are clipped do not adjust to current window size automatically when window is shrunk or expanded any program does thisgeez  highlighting needs more colors instead of brown mustard yellow no customer support responses either evernote must have been taken over by students it is not even fun to use anymore because it is slow as hell  this is especially for serious business users any five star ratings down here must have been given by employees under different themes this program has really retarded over the years they need to stick to improving their bread and butter instead of selling side junk and features that are useless well they got my money this time so i have to put up with it for a few more months the lack of pdf support really is terrible for a program like this
great internal comms system for our business
simply good but i think loss of reply option keeps people away from this app because especially in the groups it is necessary to show whom your chatting with
keep calm and play temple run it is really fun the graphic is great and you will never feel boring with that game

messengerfacebook integration issue ever since the last update initial received messages do not get pushed to the messenger app and you do not get notification in the facebook app or messenger app you open the facebook app and happen to see you have a message you have to click the icon and it opens messenger subsequent messages go through messenger app unless you close the chat head then you start over with no notification and having to go through the facebook app
i hated it i am able to log in successfully but after some days   there comes the message saying  unfortunately twitter has stopped first time i let it go then again the next day comes the same message i reported then again let it go then the next day comes again the same message i cannot tolerate it this message comes more than 15 times a day when i start browsing on twitter there comes again  truly why are you creating this type of stupid social networking sites if it is nawt useful

good but not the better i cannot see the videos sometimes the notifications are bad and always the app is not responding this actually is the worst update please check it
updates poorly current update clears the cache forcing you to log in again and of course i have not logged in in over three years and do not know the password  try to do a password reset and the app says the email is not valid  why would you clear auto login information in an update

extremely useful app but has a tendency every so often to glitch out and eat half my battery before i realize what it is doing also needs to let users define a cap on how much device storage it can hog i recently discovered this app eating nearly a gig of my tablets already scarce internal storage all on its own i now clear its data manually every few weeks to stop this

erroneous app  the wechat app is not loading my location data and therefore i am not able to find people nearby the previous version used to work fine in my droid but the new version is irritating me a lot now this app is of no use if i cannot explore new friends in my locality

usefull no others app like this
good its very good to use    but i found some fualts   while writing lengthy status the words which we enter at starting will not be visible so to edit those words we should slide through the text we have written   so make status editing line step by step instead a single line
