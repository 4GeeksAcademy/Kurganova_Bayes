puro malware viva telegram nose como han hecho que con la nueva funcin de marshmallow de compartir que te salgan contactos directamente solo te salga whatsapp siempre uso telegram y han conseguido que nunca me salga esta funcin con telegram y solo con whatsapp desinstalando ya
down to 1 star after backward redesign this app design was perfectly adequate as of fall 2015 then one of these useless all new redesigns was perpetrated  now the old controls that let me manage the notification sound silent vibrate etc are nowhere to be found  had to turn off notifications totally to keep my phone quiet that is unforgivably incompetent  i find the overall design more confusing than prior layout as many other reviewers do   boo  from 4 stars to 1
the fail boat has arrived the 60 version is touted as being advanced but in fact it contains a big old disappointment the widget which was not even available when google urged us to switch our sms function to hangouts is now no longer available wth  fail why do i want to use an sms app or any messaging app which cannot even give me a quick review widget on my home screen  pffft  rolled back to 42 apk and using the standalone google messenger app which offers not one but two excellent widgets one  personspecific
cannot get off first base having give problems synchronizing with the web version  keeps asking for login password and never goes further  reinstalling for last time before i give up
decembers update this recent december 2015 update has made the gameplay so lopsided that i can not compete with anyone i attack there is now no reason for me to invest anymore time in coc can no longer protect my loot and no shield
sony xperia z1 very good as always but since last update i cannot seem to be able to change the ringtone reverts back to default
this is it so this is going to be the list of things you need to improve for constant five stars  include more emojis  the ones you provided do not even express enough feelings of a dog   provide instructions somewhere because people have uninstalled this app because they were more confused than they were thankful to you guys  when i capitalize english letterd only one letter is capitalized and it goes back to lowercase fix this  you guys are awesome i love this app  no more bugs keep up the great work 
this has made my life hell it really sucks my cell hanged most of the time when it was there needs to improve so much   
notifications not working i do not get notify about anything new followers retweet likes non of that and yes i have enabled all the notifications in the settings but nothing happened 
this update sucks i cannot open the game anymore just crashed damn it i have an on going war but the app will not run if there is a half star option to rate this i would give you that fix this as soon as possible
love new material design
nice apps
i cannot find near by people around me unable to load location data fix as soon as possible
app stops mid call having an issue with viber at the moment on my android usually great app but stops working a random timesvery annoying  have uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times now may need to find another app
so much room for improvement the twitter app has been around for several years and yet it still has not lived up to its full potential here is an example how do not we have the capability to save gifs and videos not only that but it would be cool if we can customize and have different layouts and appearances simple updates like those would make this app so much better not lame ones like changing favorites to likes hopefully these ideas can be considered for 2016
fix or i quit do not download this game the new update sucks and is just a money grab for the developers the game will not load half the time and it kicks you off before you can even play not to mention the new rules are made to make you buy gems rather than raid for supplies i have used a lot of money over the years yes years to have you all of a sudden change the rules on farming and game play fix these issues or i am done but from what i see in the other comments i do not think the developers even care
firefox is getting better  slowly it crashes regularly it does not play video on youtube otherwise it is a promising fast browser i still miss the gesturesswipes and a well organized homepage with my selected bookmarks see ucbrowser hd
candy crush i have been  having trouble playing on candy crush so in the end i uninstalled it  i then reinstalled and signed back in in doing this i am back to my level but lost all my boosters

always entertaining we all know angry birds by now definitely an enjoyable and entertaining game to help you kill time the only thing that i do not like about it are the advertisements when i am playing with my wifi of data turned on they can be a bit disruptive during game play
videos and notifications my videos have not been working for a long time on this app whenever i try to watch a video someone else has posted its black and white and all glitchy i sometimes have no way of fixing it next i have not been getting notifications in the app i get them on my status bar but when i go on the app i do not get a little number by the bell

i cannot send or read a message from facebook because the message icon has gone it replaced by a messenger icon on top so everytime i received a message i have to go to browser to see it because i do not have a messenger app and sometimes i cannot even read a message at all because i do not always have a wifi connection  i really hate it since i have been using mobile data sometimes hope yu can fix it soonest
only miss cache to be bought
works fine for the most part not sure why it decides to sometimes notify me and sometimes not i guess it has something to do with inactivity on other logged in devices i am usually logged in 247 on 2 computers and a phone

i wish there is a mute button for selected people i like it so far but it is more like a skype now but i hope next update the will be option like mute button where i can mute someone so that i will not recieve any notification from that particular person without deleting the message or blocking them coz that would be so rude if i do that or option where i can hide the seen or a mark as unread other than that it is good i liked it that is all my concern

bait and switch i purchased my 3rd samsung tablet with  advertisement of free gifts one of them being 48 additional gb cloud storage for 2 years  the 2nd samsung tablet i bought also had this free gift and it was a nightmare to get samsung and dropbox to honor it  so after buying this 3rd high end tablet with the same claim of the free 48gb for 2 years in the fine print which you can only see after purchasing the tablet dropbox only honors the offer on the first device you purchased and you are disqualified for all future devices  this is sleazy and bait and switch  free not subject to any compensation encumbrance repayment in kind etc  because of this bait and switch advertising on the part of samsung and dropbox i suggest you really find out what kind of company dropbox is before using their services

browser gone back downhill constantly hangs now after last update and fc still does not keep pages in memory when app minimised which is a pain when streaming music etc app does not use user input options ignores them again still no propper changelog for  latest version either in playstore description or on mozzs www page  shame that ff are not listening to its users and seem totally ignorant to the fact that there is a rating system on playstore  also they keep editing my review

i love playing candy crush but why when you go to another episode  you have to wait for along time for example i was in level 50 and i passed it and had to wait 75 hours for episode 3 the game is good and very addictive but i do not like the waiting for the episodes  by the way good work
richard perez like itmoved it to sd card and could not get it backnow trying to re download for like three hoursout of high speed dataand cannot connect to wifido not know why or if download going to be complete should have waited before i rated it four stars
useful and well designed however glitchy the app is really well designed however i have begun to notice that if you end a call while it was on mute or if the call loses reception because of wifi issues on either persons end the app does not record how long the conversation lasted in fact it does not show that a call even took place
not too good please fix the voice and video calling and then you know it would be nice of there is a kind of sound when a message gets sent like most texting apps in this app though it just shows now and there is no sound or anything not a nuisance but it is better with a sound
rubbish the amount of memory it gives for free is rubbish it is very little compared to one drive they also need to fix the drop box when you upload or dowload large files it does not do it straight away generally expensive to get more memory need to give more free memory without crazy price tiers never will i use drop box again people out there check other clouds eg one drive gmail drive just other drives very dissapointed with dropbox
even though i am loving the new update but this breaks the default contacts app on the note 5 under accounts linkedin sync has no account header name and that breaks editing of contacts  update opened a ticket with linkedin support and they agreed that the contacts app break on merged contacts is a bug this is with their engineering team to be fixed update2  contacts force close exists as off version 4011 update3  finally the contacts bug has been fixed

great app but one problem ruins it i love the firefox for android it is fast and efficient and all the addons are great yet the menu key problem ruins the app firefox will automatically turn on or off the menu key based on if it detects a hardware menu button the only  problem is it gets it wrong sometimes and there is no way to force it

mic on speaker is not working with oneplusx works okay but when put on speaker on one plus x mic stops working it works for skype and normal calls only for hangouts this issue is there
not for me i thought its better than multi language keyboard but its nowhere close to it main problem is that it does not follow the traditional nepali keyboard pattern this may be enough for some to  post a short comment but not enough for the ones who likes to write in correct nepali
i wish posts popped up in the order they were posted and not get bumped up to the top every time someone comments on it i end up seeing the same ones over and over even though they are old and missing newer ones
light fast and comfortable apps when i compare 3 different browser watch speed connection ram and cpu usage then i know opera and their products is very good for smartphone and pcs

ehhh at first i gave whatsapp 5 stars i am now decreasing them to three there are multiple reasons for this 1 let me send videos no matter how long they are 2 create a feature where i can make custom vibrations for different contacts 3 being completely invisible when i block someone 4 wake screen when i get a message notification 5 if i choose to mark a message as unread it should reflect to the sender that the message is unread 6 make video chat available 7 update emojis

favorite menu update is suboptimal the new update puts the entire list of favorites into view from most recent instead of returning me to my previous folder which it always has this requires more time and clicking to get to the desired folder please give an option to return it to the previous version
frequently resets once again it has reset and taken all stored boosters this has gone on about four times now within a couple of weeks of each other i do not understand why that information is not stored since things like your level and gold are retained
i get all these requests on fb but yet i go on candy crush and nothing getting very tired of it then using the special candys they do not even do anything anymore what use to clear all rows no clears 3 no wonder no one plays this anymore
booster should be internet independent why internet connection required to get daily spin it should be  part of game itself every time i have open net connection to get daily spin unacceptable
camera option is horrible you cannot crop the image sideways it has to be perfect square or rectangle  camscanner or microsoft lens are  better options for document images and it needs notebooks within notebooks the camera flash always on and when you do needs it it takes very long time to turn itself off after taking the picture the document camera likewise needs to detect the edge of the document editing the images must be done within the interface without going through skitch

the most useful app in the marketplace if used properly    if you have ever thought how nice it would be to get rid of all the paper and clutter in your life and yet still have it available anytimeall the time using powerful searches then evernote is for you take a picture of anything and store it scan paper using your smart phone or scanner and store it all in a note forward emails directly into evernote drag and drop computer files create a note using your finger in handwriting or text mode clip pages or parts of web pages use voice

new version makes it harder to use linkedin especially find the groups you subscribe to and comment in them  submitting issues does not seem to work in the mobile app the submit button is never enabled this last update was a loser
the best game about they do not call this the no1 app for nothing its the original and best clean game about one needs to work out how best to strike the piggy structures by flinging the birds in a sling funny though i thought they had wings it is a wonderful novel idea for a game and will no doubt will continue to appeal to a wide audience for some time to come it is as big as what the old lemmings game was in the 1990s it is so addictive and fun to play whilst having a good feel about it for me beats angry birds 2 game very easily and will no doubt remain so for the near future the only flaw in it is loads of adds and becomes so slow when connected to the internet but thankfully the in game adds can be binned for a small fee but it also plays fine offline
it was okay but now complete crap why do one now have to change between profiles to see sms or hangouts before this app but much better where you could always easy select if you wanted to send an sms or hangout now this app is completely useless

often painfully slow needs a useful tablet ui quick reply and the ability to send video some of these are features the ios version has had for almost 2 years and that is not really excusable from the company that runs android this is the kind of thing that makes people switch to ios or makes android phone lovers buy ipads instead of android tablets
